      "description": "Beta program reveals average self-installation time of 3.5 hours vs target of 1.5 hours. Primary issues: Wi-Fi range to sensor hub, sensor calibration, and mobile app pairing. 40% of beta users required phone support, averaging 25 minutes per call. At scale, this would cost $18 per unit in support.",
